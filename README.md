# OpenRent UX

This project is a redesign of the OpenRent property search interface, focusing on a clean and user-friendly experience. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Google Maps for displaying property locations.

NOTE - Property locations are not displayed in the map.

## Brief

If you could take a page on our site (any you like), and put together an alternative design/UI/UX. I wouldn't spend _too_ much time on this and no more than 2 hours, but bonus points for it working with a live demo! The idea here is to see, without any real brief, what you'd do to our UI / UX. It's also hopefully a chance to show off technical, design and product development ability!

I chose to to redesign the property search interface.

## Deployment

A working demo is available at [OpenRent UX Demo](https://open-rent-ux.vercel.app/).
